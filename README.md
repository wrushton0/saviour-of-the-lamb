**Description**

Saviour of the Lamb is a 2D top-down shooter where you play as a farmer who must fight cultists to save his lamb and lead it home. It is set at night in the eerie forest near the farmerâ€™s property. The cultists will attack you with crossbows, staffs, fire spells and will try to snatch your lamb and take it away, all while you fight back with a crossbow and a pair of sharp wool shears.
